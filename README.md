## GeoC-Segmenter
## Summary:
An end-to-end Computer Vision project focused on the topic of Image Segmentation (specifically Semantic Segmentation).
We used [LandCover.ai](https://landcover.ai.linuxpolska.com/) as a dataset to lean this task. This dataset was built to execute and test classification based models.


This project uses "poetry" to manage and install dependencies. If your not familliar with this tool check out the following [documetation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

Poetry resolves all dependencies for you (in a multiplatform way) and creates a `poetry.lock` file with the found solution, which you can then share or just commit.

#### Adding dependencies

Run:

```bash
poetry add <package-name>
```

or manually edit [this file](./pyproject.toml), then run:

```bash
poetry lock
```

### Activate your work environment

To activate your poetry env, run:

```bash
poetry shell
```
